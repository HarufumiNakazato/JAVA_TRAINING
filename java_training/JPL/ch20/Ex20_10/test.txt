In the Java programming language, programs are built from classes. From a class definition, you can create
any number of objects that are known as instances of that class. Think of a class as a factory with blueprints
and instructions to build gadgetsobjects are the gadgets the factory makes.

A class contains members, the primary kinds being fields and methods. Fields are data variables belonging
either to the class itself or to objects of the class; they make up the state of the object or class. Methods are
collections of statements that operate on the fields to manipulate the state. Statements define the behavior of
the classes: they can assign values to fields and other variables, evaluate arithmetic expressions, invoke
methods, and control the flow of execution.

Long tradition holds that the first sample program for any language should print "Hello, world":
